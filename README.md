## Description

[MediaWiki](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki) is a free and open-source wiki software package written in PHP. It serves as the platform for **Wikipedia** and the other Wikimedia projects, used by hundreds of millions of people each month. MediaWiki is localised in over 350 languages and its reliability and robust feature set have earned it a large and vibrant community of third-party users and developers.

Social Wiki is a project made on MediaWiki by [Santosh Kumar](https://gitlab.com/skp098) to help developers to understand the functionality of MediaWiki and how it works. This project tells how to use MediaWiki Extension like PageForms and Cargo. Also in later versions this will include custom development of extensions for MediaWiki.
